The statue is a symbol of freedom and is one of the most recognizable icons in the world. The statue is made of copper and was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi. It depicts a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom. The statue holds a torch and a tablet inscribed with the date of the American Declaration of Independence. Visitors can take a ferry to Liberty Island to tour the statue and its museum.
